# Are My Climbing Shoes Back In Stock!?

Climbing shoes in [Rock and Run](https://rockrun.com/collections/climbing-shoes) go on sale all the time, but unfortunately the ones that are in my size and within my budget are always out of stock!
What do you do in this case? Dedicate my first complete programming script to making my life a bit easier....

Current [script](https://github.com/pymche/Are-My-Climbing-Shoes-Back/blob/master/script.py) runs through all climbing shoes, with a budget of Â£50 and size preference of 5.5.

### Installation
1. Install Selenium
2. Install latest version of Chromedriver
3. Set up environment variables for email and password for email set up
4. Launchd in MacOS to run script periodically
