# Are My Climbing Shoes Back In Stock!?

Climbing shoes in [Rock and Run](https://rockrun.com/collections/climbing-shoes) go on sale all the time, but unfortunately the ones that are in my size and within my budget are always out of stock!
Consider this publication a celebration of my first complete programming script and me not giving up halfway through!

This script runs through catalogue of climbing shoes, clicks on products that are within budget, check for availability in preferred shoe size and keep track of available items in a separate file, which content will be sent as an email to notify user.

Current [script.py](https://github.com/pymche/Are-My-Climbing-Shoes-Back/blob/master/script.py) runs through all climbing shoes, with a budget of £100 and size preference of 6.
[Womens_shoes.py](https://github.com/pymche/Are-My-Climbing-Shoes-Back/blob/master/Womens_Shoes.py) for women's shoes, budget of £50 and size 5.5.
